        <p class="mb-4">
          The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual international program that awards stipends (of US$3,000 in the 2019 edition) for Indian students who successfully complete a requested free and open-source software coding project during the summer. In 2021, NIT Hamirpur had 18 students, 4th highest in the world for any institution, to clear GSoC. This is a testament to the developed coding culture in the institute.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Application</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          To apply to Google Summer of Code, students need to write an application proposal to their respective mentoring organisations. Often mentoring organisations have their own application templates which typically ask the student to give biographical information, details of the project and a timeline. The application window typically opens up in March for a period of eleven days but it is recommended that students start working on their applications as soon as the list of participating organisations is announced.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Eligibility</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          To participate in GSoC one needs to be a student and should be more than 18 years old before the results are announced. There is no other requirement for department or year of study. Also, you cannot participate in Google Summer of Code more than two times.
